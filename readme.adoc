= RISC-V Audiomark - Coding Challenge

This repo contains implementation the following function in C:

``void q15_axpy_rvv(const int16_t *a, const int16_t *b, int16_t *y, int n, int16_t alpha);``

that computes, ``for all i in [0..n):``
``y[i]=sat_q15(a[i]+α⋅b[i])y[i]``

== Implementation Overview

=== Scalar Reference:
The scalar implementation performs:
. Q15 × Q15 multiply
. Accumulation with a Q15 addend
. Saturation to the int16_t range

This version is used as a reference for verification.

=== The RVV implementation uses:
. Vector agnostic loops via ``vsetvl``
. 16-bit vector load (``vle16``)
. Widen multiply (``vwmul``)
. Widen accumulation in 32-bit lanes
. Saturation and narrowing back to Q15
. Vector store (``vse16``)

== Building:
``make``

== Running:
``qemu-riscv32 axpy-rvv-q15.elf``
